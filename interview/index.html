		<h1>Interview With Spencer Drummond</h1>

		<h4>By Drew Elliott</h4>

		<h3> What makes a website good and why?</h3>

		<p>For me, a great website is one that catches my attention the moment I arrive to it's homepage. If it has an intriguing layout and easy to read font with creative accents I'm a lot more likely to read it's content and stay on it longer.</p>

		<h3>What is a design you like to see in a website and why?</h3>

		<p>Depending on what the website is, I look for a company logo and/or it's overall website colour story and if it makes sense with their content. I can appreciate any design in a website as long as I can see that thought and time went into designing it; and if it's overall polished.</p>

		<h3>What projects do you like to do in design and why?</h3>
		
		<p>Any project that allows creative freedom is one I definitely more time and effort into because I'm allowed to incorporate my own thoughts and ideas to make it more my own. It feels less like a school  assignment and more like my own personalized project.</p>
		
		<h3>How much does critisim effect you and why?</h3>
		
		<p>I'm always asking for constructive criticism from both my classmates and family and friends to better my design skills. I get too caught up in what I like that I sometimes forget to make sure I'm reaching many other audiences by ensuring my work is versatile and applies to a broader audience. Criticism effects me very positively because it lets me take a step back from my work and see what I could do to either take away or add more to it to ensure it's the best work I can produce.</p>
		
		<h3>What is your mainn source of inspiration and why?</h3>

		<p>My main source of inspiration is mostly my job and my older sister. My current job aligns quite well with the field I'm in in allowing me to sometimes get inspired from both to apply to the other. Some ideas I have for my job could be used in my school projects and vis versa. I get inspired almost every work shift in how I could incorporate the two together now and further down the road in a possible career. My older sister has already gone to college and university for arts and design. With her having so much more experience and knowledge in the field I'm always asking her for ideas and what she thinks about my own.</p>

		<h3>What is your favourite aspect of design and why?</h3>

		<p>Design as a whole has so many different aspects it's difficult to narrow it down to just one. If I were to choose one it would be illustration because for the way I process my work and art as a whole I have to sketch it out and come up with my designs and ideas on paper first. From there I'm able to use my design skills to vectorize my work to then make it digital for any website or printing projects I might have.</p>
