<h3>Sun Tzu</h3>
<h4>War</h4>
<body>
	<main>
		<p class="one">
			The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.</p>
		<p><span class="first-letter">If</span> 
			<div class="break">fighting is sure to result in victory, than you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.</div></p>
		<p class="one">The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.</p>
		<p>To fight and conquer in all our battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.</p>
